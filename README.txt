Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project
This repository is submitted for Getting and Cleaning Data final project. The instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset is included.

Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files:
1. CodeBook.md is the code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations that I performed to clean up the data

2. run_analysis.R performs the data preparation, followed by the five steps required as described in the course project's definition:
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
